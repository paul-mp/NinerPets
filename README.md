Many pet owners, specifically students and faculty at UNCC may sometimes struggle to keep track of their pet’s health records and appointments. It can be difficult to dig through scattered documents, emails, and notes for important information about one’s pet such as exam details or vaccination records. This can lead to problems such as missed appointments and delayed treatments. To maintain the health and safety of one’s pet, UNCC students and faculty can utilize NinerPets to ensure their pets are staying up to date with medications, vaccinations, and appointments. NinerPets also makes it easier to find veterinarians and pet stores in the area by providing locations of what's nearby."#NinerPets"
